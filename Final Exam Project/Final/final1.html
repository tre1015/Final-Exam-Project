<h2>What is Ransomware?</h2>
  

<p>Ransom ware is a virus that infects a computer, by someone opening a malicious e-mail that may look like an e-mail that someone is familiar with. 
Once the link is opened the user's computer is infected. The virus locks up all the files in the computer or network of the user. An encryption key is required in order to access the files for the computer. 
The only way to gain access to the files would be to pay the hacker. Hackers use this method of gaining money for the unsuspected victims.</p>

<p>Another tactic used in ransomware is something that will lock your computer and keep you from logging in unless the user pays up. 
This type of tactic usually displays a threatening message stating that the userâ€™s computer was used for something illegal and you can 
get your computer back and avoid prosecution by paying a small fine.</p>
