<h2>What are the issues of Ransomware?</h2>


	<dt><strong>The Main Problem with Ransomware</strong></dt>
	<p>Cyber criminals cannot be trusted. Even if the computer user pays up, it doesn’t guarantee that the cyber criminal will give their files back.
There are ransomware programs that don’t ask the victim of it for money. Most of the time, they will take money from the account of a victim or steal liquid currency.</p><dt> 

	
	<dt><strong>How can you rescue your computer if you get infected?</strong></dt>
	<p>Many of the non-encrypting types of ransomware can be removed by booting into safe mode and running an anti-malware tool. 
If that fails the user could use a bootable removable tool to a flash drive and run the program. This may not work if you’ve been 
attacked with the encrypted types of ransomware you may be out of luck. Encrypted ransomware uses strong encryption algorithms.
Always back up your data on something that is offline.</p><dt>
